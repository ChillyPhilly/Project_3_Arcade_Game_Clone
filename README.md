# Udacity Project 3 - Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
This is my take on the classic arcade game clone project, mimicking 'Frogger'. The images and skeleton code were all provided by Udacity, and I've created the functionality.

Hope you enjoy!! :)

## How to run the game
1. Download or clone the files
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Select character using left and right, then enter to confirm
4. Move your character to the river or pick up a gem to earn a pointer
5. *Avoid the giant bugs!!*
6. See how many points you can get before being squashed by the giant bugs!
